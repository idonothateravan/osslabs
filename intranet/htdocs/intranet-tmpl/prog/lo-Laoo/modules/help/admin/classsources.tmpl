<h1>About Classification Sources</h1>

<p>Define classification sources (i.e., call number schemes) used by your collection. You can also define 'filing rules' used for sorting call numbers.</p>
	   
<p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> You do not have the option to 'define' a new filing rule. Currently, the filing rules and sorting routines are statically defined with options available in the dropdown menu when creating or editing a 'classification source' or 'filing rule'.</p>
	   
<p><strong>TIP:</strong> In the future, this features will be expanded to allow new filing rules to be created (defined) on the fly. In other words, in addition to choosing from a static sorting routine or filing rule, you will be able to actually to define new ones.</p>

<h1>To add a new 'Classification Source'...</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Click 'New Classification Source'</li>
			<li>Enter a 'Classification source code'</li>
			<li>Enter a 'Description' for your new classification source</li>
			<li>Note if the classification source is in use (check the box for 'yes' and leave unchecked for 'no')</li>
			<li>Choose a 'filing rule' from the dropdown menu to associate with your new classification source</li>
			<li>Click 'Save'</li>
		</ul>	   
<p>IMPORTANT: 'Source in use?' controls whether source is available in item editor. For example, Koha ships with Dewey and LCC rules but a Dewey library may not want catalogers to mistakenly use LCC as an item callnumber type. To accomplish this, check box 'source in use?' only for the Dewey Classification Source and leave 'source in use' for all others unchecked.</p>

			<li>Choose a 'filing routine' from the dropdown menu to associate with your new filing rule</li>
			<li>Click 'Save'</li>
		</ul>
