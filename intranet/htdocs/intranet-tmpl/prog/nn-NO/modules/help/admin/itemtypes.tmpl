<h1>Item types management</h1>

<p>You can define as many item types as you want.</p>
<p>The item types are the &quot;categories&quot; into which your library items fall. For instance, you probably want to have videocassettes in a different category from non-fiction books, and mysteries in a different category from children's picture books. If you already are using a commercial ILS, you almost certainly already have all of your materials divided up into such categories. Now you need to tell Koha what your categories are.</p>
<p>The itemtype code is limited to four characters. This code is rarely displayed by Koha; instead the description of the type will be what users see.</p>
<p>&quot;Rental charge&quot; is any amount you might charge to users for borrowing items of a certain type (like videos).</p>
<p>&quot;Renewals allowed&quot; indicates how many times an items of this type may be renewed.</p>
<p>Item types are useful for many things, and <strong>very</strong> important in controlling how Koha works :</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Patrons can search on item types</li>
		<li>Issuing rules are set for item types (and for patron types / libraries)</li>
	</ul>
<p>Setting up item types is one of the first things you should do after installing the Koha software.</p>
