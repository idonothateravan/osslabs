<h1>Holidays Calendar Help</h1><h2>What is the Holidays Calendar?</h2>
<p>The Holidays Calendar allows the library to define days where the library is closed. Circulation rules are then recalculated to taken in to account that library is closed and there will be no one present to return items.</p>
<p>There are 2 types of holiday:</p>
	<ol>
		<li><strong>Unique Holiday</strong>:One off events or closeures.</li>
		<li><strong>Repeatable Holidays</strong>:Holidays that either repeat the same day of every week or repeated yearly on the same date.</li>
	</ol>	Holidays are set per library and the same holiday will need to be set for all libraries in a system.
<h2>Updating the Calendar:</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Go to the 'Tools' module (usually under 'More' in your Global Nav)</li>
		<li>Choose 'Calendar'</li>
		<li>From the pull down you can choose which branch to apply holidays to.
		<ul>
			<li>
		    <span style="background-color: #ffff99">
TIP: At present you will have to enter holidays in for each branch, there is no way to apply holidays to all branches at once.</span></li>
		</ul></li>
		<li>To add a new holiday, click on the date you'd like to add a holiday to
		<ul>

		</ul></li>
		<li>Click on the 18th of February 2008 and fill in the necessary fields for your library.</li>

			<li>
		    <span style="background-color: #ffff99">
TIP: An example of a repeatable holiday would be Christmas, New Year's or a staff in-service day</span></li>
		</ul></li>
