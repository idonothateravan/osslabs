<h1>Currencies administration</h1>

<p>Define the currencies you deal with here.</p>

<p>You should at least define your local currency here, giving it a name (like US DOLLAR or EURO) and setting the "rate" at 1. If you do business with vendors who charge in a different currency, enter a name for that currency (e.g. PESO) and set the approximate exchange rate compared to your currency. (Note: names are limited to 10 characters or less.) The exchange rate is used to calculate the remain balances in your materials budgets when you purchase materials using "normal" acquisitions.</p>
