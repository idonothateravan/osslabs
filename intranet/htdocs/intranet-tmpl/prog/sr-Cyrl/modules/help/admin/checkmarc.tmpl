<h1>MARC Bibliographic Framework Test</h1>

<p>Once you have completed the process of setting up your MARC Frameworks and checked your MARC to Koha mapping, this program checks for major errors in your MARC setup.</p>

<p>This MARC check does not guarantee that you will like the first results of your efforts to set up your MARC displays, etc. -- it simply checks for major errors. You will probably revise your MARC setup several times before you are completely pleased with it. Be sure to run the MARC Bibliographic Framework Test after every revision.</p>
