<h1>Koha 2 MARC links</h1>

<p>This page provides a simplified way to map your MARC tags and subfields to the non-MARC Koha database tables <b>for default biblio framework</b>. This can also be done while setting the MARC tag structure, but it is easier to see the relationship between the MARC database and the Koha database here.</p>

<p>The pull-down menu lists all the Koha tables that can receive values from the MARC records. The columns from each table are listed below the pull-down menu.</p>

<p>Do not expect to have every Koha table.column mapped to a MARC subfield. Some (such as biblionumber, biblioitemnumber, and itemnumber) are values generated by Koha and will probably be automatically mapped. Others are flags which are set in the course of normal circulation activities and will contain information that is not part of your MARC record.</p>

<p>This is a one-to-one mapping. In other words, a MARC tag/subfield can be mapped to one, and only one, Koha table.column.</p>

<p>MARC data that is not mapped to a Koha table does not disappear -- it is simply not available for display on circulation screens and on some search results screens.</p>
