<h1>Patron attribute types</h1>A patron attribute (or extended patron attribute) is an additional piece of information associated with a patron record.  Each attribute has a type that specifies whether the attribute is repeatable, can serve as a unique identifier, can take a password, and whether it can be used to search for patron records in the staff interface.
The list of attribute types is controlled by staff with 'superlibrarian' permissions.<br/>
	<ul>
		<li>Get there: Patrons &gt; Patron Record &gt; More &gt; Set Permissions</li>
	</ul>Once an attribute type is defined, values for that attribute can be added to the patron record via the staff interface or the batch patron import.
Two uses of extended attributes are:

	<ul>
		<li>defining additional unique identifiers, such as a campus student ID number, a library staff HR number, and so on.  These IDs can be used for searching or matching and overlaying records during a batch import.</li>
		<li>additional statistical categories.  For example, a library could define an attribute type for tracking the academic major of a student patron. Any number of attributes of this sort could be defined.</li>
	</ul>The extended attributes feature is completely optional.  If the 'ExtendPatronAttributes' system preference is OFF, customizable patron attributes will not be usable.
<h2>Add Patron Attribute</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Click 'Patron attribute types'</li>
		<li>	   
	   IMPORTANT: You will need to have ExtendedPatronAttributes turned on
		<ul>
			<li>Get there: More &gt; Administration &gt; General system preferences &gt; Patrons &gt; ExtendedPatronAttributes</li>
		</ul></li>
		<li>To add a new Patron Attribute, click 'New Patron Attribute Type'</li>
		<li>The 'Patron attribute type code' should be unique and is the only required field
		<ul>
			<li>TIP: This field is not editable once it is set</li>
		</ul></li>
		<li>Fill in all of the fields you need for your attribute
		<ul>
			<li>TIP: The repeatibility and unique_id settings of an attribute type cannot be changed after creation - this is to avoid having to deal with changing constraints if an attribute type is already in use by patron records</li>
		</ul></li>
		<li>Click 'Save'</li>
		<li>TIP: An attribute type cannot be deleted if it is used by any patron records</li>
