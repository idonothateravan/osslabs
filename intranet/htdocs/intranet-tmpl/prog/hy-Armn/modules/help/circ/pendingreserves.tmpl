<h1>Pending Holds Help</h1>

<h2>Ի՞նչ է &quot;Սպասվող պահումը&quot;</h2>
 
<p>A Pending Hold is a Hold that has been placed by a Patron that has not been &quot;Filled&quot;. Where Filled means that the item is now ready for the Patron to pick up.</p>
<p>This report indicates all the items that have Holds on them that are currently held on the library shelves or stack.</p>

<h2>Ինչպե՞ս է Պահումը դուրս գրվում այս ցուցակից։</h2>
<p>Locate the Item on the shelf and then in Circulation, scan or enter the barcode of the item to Check In the item. The item has now been &quot;seen&quot; by Koha and the status has changed. The item will now appear on the &quot;Holds Awaiting Pickup&quot; report.</p>
