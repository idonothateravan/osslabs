<h1>Tags</h1>

<p>This tool gives librarians the option to moderate patron added tags.&nbsp; This moderation page will show up regardless of the system preference settings related to tagging.</p>

<p style="background-color: #ffe599">IMPORTANT: This feature is still experimental</p>   

<p style="background-color: #ffe599">IMPORTANT: Tagging will make use of AJAX capability in JavaScript-enabled browsers</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Go to the 'Tools' module (usually under 'More' in your Global Nav)</li>
		<li>Choose 'Tags'</li>
		<li>From this menu you can approve or reject tags
		<ul>
			<li>
		    <span style="background-color: #ffe599">
TIP: Note that you are approving the terms used, but not the title the terms are applied to, moderation is for checking that terms are approriate for your library</span></li>
		</ul></li>
		<li>The 'Weight' refers to the number of times the tag has been used within the system</li>
		<li>To approve a tag, click 'approve' in that line or check the box and click 'approve' at the top
		<ul>
			<li>Approving a tag adds it to your whitelist</li>
		</ul></li>
		<li>To reject a tag, click 'reject' in that line or check the box and click 'reject' at the top
		<ul>
			<li>Rejecting a tag adds it to your blacklist</li>
		</ul></li>
		<li>The terms summary in the top left will allow you to filter your results by tag status</li>
		<li>The status of tags can always be edited by clicking on one of these filters and changing the status</li>
		<li>You can test terms against you whitelist or blacklist by using the test tool</li>
		<li>If a term has been rejected the test will tell you that that term is prohibited.&nbsp; If it has been approved it will show that that word is allowed.
		<ul>
			<li>
		    <span style="background-color: #ffe599">
TIP: The blacklist is already populated with some key terms depending on the dictionary you're using</span></li>
		</ul></li>
		<li>When a patron adds a tag to an item that a librarian has already rejected, it will automatically be rejected.</li>
	</ul>   
   <h3>Will I be notified when new tags are added?</h3>
   <p>This feature is yet to be developed, but is in the works.</p>
