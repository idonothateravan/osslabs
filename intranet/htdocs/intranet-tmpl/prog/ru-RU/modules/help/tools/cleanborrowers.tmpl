<h1>Patrons (anonymize, bulk-delete)</h1>

<p>This tool allows you to bulk anonymize circulation histories or bulk delete patron records. This  means that the system keeps a link between old loans and their items but severs the link to the borrower.</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Once in the tool, you have two options</li>
			<li>Check the box next to the action(s) you'd like to perform
			<ul>
				<li>To delete borrowers, enter the date since the last time they borrowed</li>
				<li>To anonymize circulation history enter the date before which you'd like that data deleted</li>
			</ul></li>
		</ul>
		
<h2>Is there a way to run this tool automatically?</h2>
<p>Not at this time.</p>
<h2>Will running this report sever the connection between patrons and items that are checked out to them currently?</h2>
<p>No, this report will only remove connections between patrons and items they have checked out in the past but have returned to the library.</p>
