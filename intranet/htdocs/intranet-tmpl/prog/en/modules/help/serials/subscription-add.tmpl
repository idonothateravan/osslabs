<h1>Add A New Serial Subscription</h1>

<h2>What do I need to setup a subscription?</h2>
<p>Before you can set up a new subscription, you will need to have set up:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>a Vendor in Acquisitions who supplies the subscription</li>
		<li>a Biblio with no items to which you can add the subscription to.</li>
	</ul>	.  
<h2>How do I set up a new subscription?</h2>
<p>There are four sections to this form:</p>

<h3>Step 1: Search for a Supplier</h3>

<p>If you want to claim any issues then you need to elect a supplier at this point.</p>
<h3>Step 2: Search for Biblio</h3>

<p>It should find the item that was just set up in Acquisitions. Note If you have not yet set this up in Acquisitions, click Create Biblio. It will take you back to Acquisitions Order Form.</p>
<h3>Step 3: Fill out other details in the Subscription Information box.</h3>
<p>This includes the Call Number, Home branch for the Serial and any notes.</p>
<p>Select the Patron Alert: you will need to choose a Notice that can be sent to patrons when a new issue arrives. To edit this notice, go to Tools &gt; Notices.</p>
<h3>Step 4: Fill out the details in the Planning box.</h3>

<p>This is a critical component of managing serials. In order to make the system predict the next issue the user must fill out each of these fields. Once completed it will populate the Numbering Calculation box below.</p>
<p>See &gt; More details about Planning</p>
<h3>Step 5: Fill out the Subscription length box</h3>

<p>Indicate the expected length of time that this serial will be subscribed to.</p>
<p>This sets up the expiry date in the system and also sets up an Alert a month before expected expiry.</p>
<h3>Step 6: Numbering Calculation</h3>

<p>If a choice has been made in the Numbering Pattern section then the Numbering Calculation will automatically be filled out and presented in this section. However, if the Numbering Pattern is &ldquo;None of the above&rdquo; then a formula will be presented and the user must fill this out.</p>
<p>See More detail about the Numbering Calculation formula</p>
<h3>Step 7: Add Subscription</h3>

<p>Once that is filled out then you see the completed details page. If there is a mistake you can go back and Edit the details.</p>
<p>Next step - Receive issues (see online help on Receive Issues page)</p><h2>How does planning work</h2>

<h3>1. First Issue ETA</h3>

<p>Displays a calendar &ndash; choose the expected date of arrival in the library. This date is for administrative purposes only. It ties in with the Claims component of the Serials Module. It is not the date of the first issue. This is selected below in the Begins On field.</p>
<h3>2. Frequency</h3>

<p>Use the drop down list to select the main frequency patterns.</p>
<h3>3. Numbering Pattern</h3>

<p>Drop down list of the main numbering patterns:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Number</li>
		<li>Volume, Number, Issue</li>
		<li>Volume, Number</li>
		<li>Volume, Issue</li>
		<li>Number, Issue</li>
		<li>Seasonal only[a]</li>
		<li>None of the above</li>
	</ul>
<p>If it is &ldquo;none of the above&rdquo; this will bring up a Numbering Calculation formula at the bottom of the screen.</p>
<p>The system handles exceptions (e.g Item arrives monthly but only 10 issues in the year). Set the rollover to the max number of issues expected in the year. Then click the &quot;Irregularity&quot; link. Choose which instances are skipped.</p>
<h3>4. Begins on</h3>

<p>Displays a calendar &ndash; choose the date of the first issue. For example, the library is subscribing to a monthly magazine and the first issue expected is the February issue. You would then choose 1st of February.</p><h2>Numbering Calculation formula</h2>
<p>The &quot;numbering formula&quot; can be filled with any text and/or numbers. Three special tokens {X}, {Y} and {Z} can be used to define the calculation formula. This allows you to define patterns not possible with the Numbering Pattern drop downs.</p><!-- TMPL_INCLUDE name="help-bottom.inc" -->
