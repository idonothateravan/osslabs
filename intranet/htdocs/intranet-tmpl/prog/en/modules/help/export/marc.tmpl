<h1>MARC Export</h1>

<p>This is a tool to export your bibliographic records in standard MARC communications format (ISO 2709). It exports only the basic bibliographic information with no holdings information other than any holdings information originally loaded into Koha using the bulkmarcimport tool.</p>

<p>You are asked to provide a starting bibliographic record number and an ending number for the export. If you want to export all of your records, leave the start and end numbers blank.</p>

<p>Records are downloaded to the workstation that requests the export and are saved in a file called "marc.pl."</p>
