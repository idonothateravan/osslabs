<h1>Circulation Check In (Returns)</h1>

<h2>How do I&nbsp; check in (return) an item?</h2><p>Simply scan or type the returned item's identifying number (usually a barcode) in the box provided.</p>
<h2>What happens if a patron has debts?</h2><p>A red box will alert you. Fines are calculated and posted the following day.</p><p>If you know the items all have fines or debts associated with them, you can chose to &quot;Forgive All Debts&quot; by using the Check box. By usiing this check box, no charges will be placed against the patrons account.</p>
<h2>What happens if the item is on reserve?</h2><p>A red typed alert saying &quot;Reserve Found&quot; will be displayed along with the Reserve listing information. Click on the confirm button to proceed. If the item is confirmed than the items status will be changed to &quot;waiting&quot;. If the item is requested by someone in another branch, then you must validate the transfer.</p> <h3>WARNING: BRANCH AND PRINTING SETTINGS.
</h3><p>Before you begin, it is very important that you take note of the branch and printer settings and change them if necessary. This should only have to be done the first time you do circulations (or returns) from a workstation, after which a browser cookie will remember the correct settings. If you do returns under the wrong branch settings Koha will reset the location of all items scanned to the incorrect branch</p>
