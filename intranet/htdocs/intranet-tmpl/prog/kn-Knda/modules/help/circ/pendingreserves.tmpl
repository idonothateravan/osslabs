<h1>Pending Holds Help</h1>

<h2>What is a &quot;Pending Hold&quot;?</h2>
 
<p>A Pending Hold is a Hold that has been placed by a Patron that has not been &quot;Filled&quot;. Where Filled means that the item is now ready for the Patron to pick up.</p>
<p>This report indicates all the items that have Holds on them that are currently held on the library shelves or stack.</p>

<h2>How does an Hold come off this list?</h2>
<p>Locate the Item on the shelf and then in Circulation, scan or enter the barcode of the item to Check In the item. The item has now been &quot;seen&quot; by Koha and the status has changed. The item will now appear on the &quot;Holds Awaiting Pickup&quot; report.</p>
<p style="background-color: #ffe599">   TIP: This report is only applicable if the ReserveNeedReturn system preference is on.</p>
