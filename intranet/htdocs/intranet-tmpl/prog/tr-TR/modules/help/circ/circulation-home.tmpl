</h3> Before you begin, it is very important that you take note of the branch and printer settings and change them if necessary. This should only have to be done the first time you do circulations from a workstation, after which a browser cookie will remember the correct settings. If you do circulations under the wrong branch settings then Koha will reset the location of all items scanned to the incorrect branch and the statistical reports will credit all circulations to the wrong branch
