<h1>Lists</h1>

<h2>Q: What are &quot;Lists&quot;?</h2>
<p>Lists are editable, permanent book lists. If the 'virtualshelves' Systems Preference has been enabled, both staff and patrons may create Lists. An item included on a List is directly linked to that item&rsquo;s bibliographic record in the Online Catalog. Clicking on the item will take you directly the the item&rsquo;s &ldquo;Details Screen&rdquo; and allow you to check for availability, find the item&rsquo;s location or reserve the item.</p>

<p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> Patrons must be logged in to their account online to create and edit lists. </p>    
<h4>TIP: Why staff might use Lists </h4>
<p>Lists are a great tool for Reader&rsquo;s Advisory. Staff can use Lists to create a variety of reading lists for patrons (for example, according to age and reading level, or on specific topics).</p><h4>TIP: Why educators might use Lists </h4>
<p>Lists can be used by professors to create a bibliography/reading list for class assignments. Clicking on an item in a List connects directly to the details page of that item in the Online Catalog. Students can easily see where the item is in the library and whether or not ist is available for checking out.</p><h2>Q: What types of &quot;Lists&quot; are there?</h2>
<p>Koha supports two types of Lists:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Public Lists: Anyone may view a public list, but only the person who created it may edit it.</li>
		<li>Private Lists: Only the person who created the list may view and edit it.</li>
	</ul><h4>TIP: Patron uses for Lists </h4>
<p>Patrons can use Lists to share their reading favorites/ preferences with other patrons by creating one or more &ldquo;Public Lists&rdquo;. By creating &ldquo;Private Lists&rdquo;, patrons can keep lists of what they&rsquo;ve read, or what they want to read for research or recreation.</p><h2>Q: How do I create a new &quot;List&quot; from the Staff Intranet?</h2>
<p>To create a new List:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Click on &ldquo;Lists&rdquo;  (You should see a list of shelves that have already been created)</li>
		<li>Click 'New List'</li>
		<li>Name your list</li>
