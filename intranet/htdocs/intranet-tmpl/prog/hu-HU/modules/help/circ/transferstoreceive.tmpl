<h2>What is a Transfer To Receive?</h2>
<p>This report shows all the items from other libraries/branches that are in transit to your branch. The status of all these items is marked as &quot;In Transit&quot;</p>

<h2>How do I process a Transfer To Receive?</h2>
<p>Once the item has physically arrived in your branch, click &quot;Receive Item&quot;. This will change the status of the item from &quot;In Transit&quot; to &quot;Waiting&quot;. The item will now show on the &quot;Holds Awaiting Pick Up&quot; report.</p>
