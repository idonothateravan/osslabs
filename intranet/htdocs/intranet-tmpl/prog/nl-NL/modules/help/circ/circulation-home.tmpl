<h1>Circulation Help</h1><h2>What can I do in Circulation?</h2>

<p>Circulation is where items are check out and in to patrons. Some libraries use different nomeclature for these functions.</p><p>Koha uses the following terms:</p><ul><li><strong>Check Out </strong>= issue an item to a patron</li><li><strong>Check In</strong> = return an item from a patron</li><li><strong>Transfer</strong> = used to change the holding branch of an item </li><li><strong>Holds</strong> = items that patrons have placed a request on (called &quot;reserves&quot; in some libraries - not to be confused with &quot;Course Reserves&quot; used in academimc libraries)</li></ul><br /><h3>INFORMATION: BRANCH AND PRINTER SETTINGS.
</h3> Before you begin, it is very important that you take note of the branch and printer settings and change them if necessary. This should only have to be done the first time you do circulations from a workstation, after which a browser cookie will remember the correct settings. If you do circulations under the wrong branch settings then Koha will reset the location of all items scanned to the incorrect branch and the statistical reports will credit all circulations to the wrong branch
