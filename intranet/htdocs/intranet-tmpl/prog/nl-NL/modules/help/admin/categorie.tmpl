<h1>Patron Categories</h1>

<p>This is where you define the types of users of your library and how they will be handled.</p>

<h2>Categories, Descriptions and Types</h2>
<p>Start by assigning a Category Code and a Description to each patron category. Each Category can be one of five types:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Adult Patrons: can be linked as &quot;guarantors&quot; to other patrons who are their dependents.  This is the default patron type.</li>
		<li>Child Patrons: a patron category that has a &quot;guarantor&quot;.</li>
		<li>Organizational Patrons: can be used for institutional members, e.g. other libraries that borrow from you, in which case Koha expects slightly different information about the institution.</li>
		<li>Professional Patrons: can also be associated with a guarantor (usually an organisation).</li>
		<li>Staff Members: A member of the library staff.</li>
		<li>Statistical Patrons: checking out to this patron type creates a statistical (local use) record but does not actually circulate materials.</li>
	</ul>
	
<h3>Note on Permissions</h3>
<p>Patrons in any category type may be assigned permissions in the staff interface.  The Staff patron type has additional security features over the other types.</p>

<h2>Enrollment Period (months)</h2>
<p>Enrollment period is a number indicating the length in months of a patron enrollment. If enrollments never expire, set this to an impossibly high number ( &gt;= 99).</p>

<h2>Upper Age Limit and Age Required</h2>
<p>Upper Age Limit and Age Required set the age parameters for this type of user. If you issue children's cards to users between the ages of 2 and 18, for example, then Age Required would be &quot;2&quot; and Upper Age Limit would be &quot;18.&quot; If there is no upper age limit, set this value to 999 (the highest allowed).</p>

<h2>Enrollment Fee and Reserve Fee</h2>
<p>Enrollment Fee and Reserve Fee (if any) should be entered either as whole numbers or with (up to) six decimal places, with no currency notation (e.g. &quot;1.250000&quot; instead of &quot;$1.25&quot;).</p>

<h2>Overdue Notice Required</h2>
<p>Overdue Notice Required lets you bypass generating overdue notices for this user type.</p>
