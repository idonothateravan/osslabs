<h1>Authority types</h1>

<p>You can define as many Authority types as you want.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>with the MARC structure button, you can define the MARC structure of a given authority type</li>
		<li>The tag reported must contain a MARC tag number. Every subfield in the selected tag will be copied to the &quot;destination tag&quot; in the biblio. for example, in UNIMARC, the tag 200 ot personal authority will be reported to 600, 700, 701, depending on what is cliqued in the biblio MARC editor.</li>
		<li>The summary contains an &quot;ISBD&quot; like description to explain how the entry must be shown in the result list. The syntax is :
		<ul>
			<li>[xxxFFFSyyy] where are up to 3 digits BEFORE the field, FFF the field number, S the subfield code, yyy up to 3 digits AFTER the field.</li>
			<li>things outside [] are kept as is (including HTML)</li>
			<li>repeatable fields are managed.
			<ul>
			</ul></li>
<p>IMPORTANT</p>
<p>In the biblio framework, the reported tag <strong>MUST</strong> contain a $9 subfield, activated in the tab where the tag is, and hidden (hidden maybe omitted, but the field has no reason to appear anywhere). The $9 subfield in the biblio will contain the Authority number (the internal Koha number)</p>
		</ul></li>
	</ul>
