<p>Ignore this one, keep the existing one.</p>

<p>You can "name" the import to help you when you need to choose between more than 1 imported biblio (or just want to keep trace on where the biblios comes from)</p>

<p>You can also change char encoding between MARC21 and UNIMARC</p>

<p><b>IMPORTANT : This tool is NOT intended to import ISO 2709 in your ACTIVE database. If you need to migrate data from another ILS, then you must consider $kohaInstall/scripts/misc/bulkmarcimport.pl</b></p>
