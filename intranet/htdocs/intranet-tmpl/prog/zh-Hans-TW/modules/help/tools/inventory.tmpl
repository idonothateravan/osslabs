<h1>財產清單/館藏清單</h1><h2>如何使用這個功能？</h2>

<p>This inventory feature works by using the &quot;Last Seen Date&quot; as criteria for building reports. From these reports the library can identify which items are missing.</p>

<h2>How do I get a file of barcodes to upload?</h2>

<p>The easiest way to generate the barcode file is to scan the barcodes of all the items on the shelf in situ to a text file. This can be done using a standard keyboard wedge type Barcode scanner and a Laptop, or using a handheld PC with an integrated scanner (e.g Palm or iPaq).</p><p>Save the file locally to your machine and then when you are attached to the network, open the Inventory/Stocktaking page again and use the &quot;Browse&quot; feature to find the file on your local drive.  Now set the last seen to the date you wish to use (normally today's date). </p>

<h2>如何找到遺失的館藏？</h2>

<p>Now you have set the Last Seen Date of the items, you can use that as a criteria to generate a report. Use the &quot;Select items you want to check&quot; feature to generate this report. </p><p>NOTE: If you have scanned all the items in your library, you will not need to change any of the default criteria.</p><p>設定 &quot;未借閱從&quot; <strong>之前 </strong>the date you used when you set the &quot;Last Seen Date&quot; when uploading the barcode file.</p><p>Press the &quot;Submit&quot; button to generate the list of items that Koha has not seen. </p>
