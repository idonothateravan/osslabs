<h1>訂購說明</h1>

<h2>什麼是購物欄和訂單？</h2>
<p>A Basket is used to group a set of order lines. An order is placed for an individual item.</p>
<p>An Order can have multiple copies/units placed against it.  A Basket can have multiple Orders.</p>

<h2>如何新增館藏到訂單？</h2>
	<ol>
		<li><strong>From an existing record -</strong> Use the search to locate the bibliographic record of the item that you wish to order more copies of.</li>
		<li><strong>來自 A 建議 - </strong>看到讀者的採訪建議，並且新增到購物籃。</li>
		<li><strong>來自新增記錄（空的）- </strong>If you know that the item is not in the library already, then create a new record from scratch.</li>
	</ol>
	
	<h3>TIP: Always check your Catalog first </h3>
<p>It is highly advisable that you get in the habit of checking the catalog first before placing an order for a new item. This saves unnecessary duplicate bibliographic records in your database and any need to merge/deduplicate records.</p>

<h2>要關閉購物籃嗎？</h2>
<p>No, this is not necessary, you will still be able to mark items received without closing a basket.  Closing a basket is good practice for keeping track of late orders which is discussed in this manual.</p><!-- TMPL_INCLUDE NAME="help-bottom.inc" -->
