<h1>流通說明</h1><h2>如何借閱？</h2>

<p>Circulation is where items are check out and in to patrons. Some libraries use different nomeclature for these functions.</p><p>Koha 使用下面詞彙：</p><ul><li><strong>歸還 </strong>= 讀者借閱館藏</li><li><strong>借閱</strong> = 讀者歸還館藏</li><li><strong>館際互借</strong> = 用來改變館藏地 </li><li><strong>預約</strong> = items that patrons have placed a request on (called &quot;reserves&quot; in some libraries - not to be confused with &quot;Course Reserves&quot; used in academimc libraries)</li></ul><br /><h3>重要：分館和印表機設定
</h3> Before you begin, it is very important that you take note of the branch and printer settings and change them if necessary. This should only have to be done the first time you do circulations from a workstation, after which a browser cookie will remember the correct settings. If you do circulations under the wrong branch settings then Koha will reset the location of all items scanned to the incorrect branch and the statistical reports will credit all circulations to the wrong branch
